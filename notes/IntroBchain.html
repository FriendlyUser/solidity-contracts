decentralized and collectively owned by multiple people. Nobody
within this group has the power to change or delete previous
transactions. Even if someone tries to do so, it will not be
accepted by other stakeholders.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Autonomy</strong> There is no single owner for blockchain-based
applications. No one controls the blockchain, but everyone
participates in its activities. This helps in creating solutions
that cannot be manipulated or induce corruption.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Intermediaries</strong> Blockchain-based applications can help remove the
intermediaries from existing processes. Generally there is a central
body, such as vehicle registration, license issuing, and so on, that
acts as registrar for registering vehicles as well as issuing driver
licenses. Without blockchain-based systems, there is no central body
and if a license is issued or vehicle is registered after a
blockchain mining process, that will remain a fact for an epoch
time-period without the need of any central authority vouching for
it.</p></li></ul> <p>There are the following two types of cryptography in computing:
Symmetric and Asymmetric</p> <h4 id="types-of-cryptography"><a href="#types-of-cryptography" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Types of cryptography</h4> <p>Symmetric cryptography refers to the process of using a single key for
both encryption and decryption.</p> <p>Asymmetric cryptography refers to the process of using two keys for
encryption and decryption. Any key can be used for encryption and
decryption. Message encryption with a public key can be decrypted using
a private key and messages encrypted by a private key can be decrypted
using a public key.</p> <p>Hashing is the process of transforming any input data into fixed length
random character data, and it is not possible to regenerate or identify
the original data from the resultant string data. Hashes are also known
as fingerprint of input data.</p> <h4 id="what-is-gas"><a href="#what-is-gas" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is Gas</h4> <p>This is also known as gas cost. There is also gas price that can be
adjusted to a lower price when the price of Ether increases and a higher
price when the price of Ether decreases.</p> <h1 id="properties-of-ethereum-transactions"><a href="#properties-of-ethereum-transactions" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Properties of Ethereum Transactions</h1> <p>A transaction has some of the following important properties related to
it:</p> <ul><li><p>The from account property denotes the account that is originating
the transaction and represents an account that is ready to send some
gas or Ether. Both gas and Ether concepts were discussed earlier in
this chapter. The from account can be externally owned or a contract
account.</p></li> <li><p>The to account property refers to an account that is receiving Ether
or benefits in lieu of an exchange. For transactions related to
deployment of contract, the to field is empty. It can be externally
owned or a contract account.</p></li> <li><p>The value account property refers to the amount of Ether that is
transferred from one account to another.</p></li> <li><p>The input account property refers to the compiled contract bytecode
and is used during contract deployment in EVM. It is also used for
storing data related to smart contract function calls along with its
parameters. A typical transaction in Ethereum where a contract
function is invoked is shown here. In the following screenshot,
notice the input field containing the function call to contract
along with its parameters:</p> <ul><li><p>The blockHash account property refers to the hash of block to
which this transaction belongs.</p></li> <li><p>The blockNumber account property is the block in which this
transaction belongs.</p></li> <li><p>The gas account property refers to the amount of gas supplied by
the sender who is executing this transaction.</p></li> <li><p>The gasPrice account property refers to the price per gas the
sender was willing to pay</p></li> <li><p>The hash account property refers to the hash of the transaction.</p></li> <li><p>The nonce account property refers to the number of transactions
made by the sender prior to the current transaction.</p></li> <li><p>The nonce account property refers to the number of transactions
made by the sender prior to the current transaction.</p></li> <li><p>The value account property refers to the amount of Ether
transferred in wei.</p></li> <li><p>The v, r, and s account properties relate to digital signatures
and the signing of the transaction.</p></li></ul></li></ul> <h1 id="properties-of-ethereum-blocks"><a href="#properties-of-ethereum-blocks" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Properties of Ethereum Blocks</h1> <ul><li><p>The difficulty property determines the complexity of the
puzzle/challenge given to miners for this block.</p></li> <li><p>The gasLimit property determines the maximum gas allowed. This helps
in determining how many transactions can be part of the block.</p></li> <li><p>The gasUsed property refers to the actual gas used for this block
for executing all transactions in it.</p></li> <li><p>The hash property refers to the hash of the block.</p></li> <li><p>The nonce property refers to the number that helps in solving the
challenge.</p></li> <li><p>The miner property is the account identifier of the miner, also
known as coinbase or etherbase.</p></li> <li><p>The number property is the sequential number of this block on the
chain.</p></li> <li><p>The parentHash property refers to the parent block’s hash.</p></li> <li><p>The receiptsRoot, stateRoot, and transactionsRoot properties refer
to Merkle trees discussed during the mining process.</p></li> <li><p>The transactions property refers to an array of transactions that
are part of this block.</p></li> <li><p>The difficulty property determines the complexity of the
puzzle/challenge given to miners for this block.</p></li></ul> <h4 id="mining-protocols"><a href="#mining-protocols" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Mining Protocols</h4> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p><strong>Proof of Work</strong></p> <p>(PoW) wherein a miner provides proof that it is has worked on

validators. Validators run software allowing them to put
transactions in blocks. The process is automated and does not
require validators to be constantly monitoring their computers. It,
however, does require maintaining the computer (the authority node)
uncompromised.</p></div> <div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p> <p>Proof of Space Time (PoST)</p> <p>apparently able to run on any computer without expensive hardware. A

differentiates it from a normal contract. These are:</p> <ul><li><p>A library cannot have a state variable</p></li> <li><p>A library cannot inherit or be inherited</p></li> <li><p>A library cannot receive ether.</p></li></ul> <p>Solidity is a work-in-progress yet well-documented language, being
gradually developed as users face various problems while implementing
smart contracts on the blockchain.</p> <h4 id="token-vs-coin"><a href="#token-vs-coin" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Token vs Coin</h4> <p>In simple words, the following three points summarize the difference
between coins and tokens:</p> <ul><li><p>Coins are separate currencies on their own blockchain, while tokens
are mainly based on a single blockchain variant</p></li> <li><p>Coins generally have a limited functionality, store-of-value, while
tokens can store a complex, multi-faceted level of values.</p></li> <li><p>Coins are mostly generated by mining a blockchain, while tokens are
generated by executing smart contracts on the blockchain.</p></li></ul> <h2 id="ponzi-scheme"><a href="#ponzi-scheme" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Ponzi Scheme</h2> <ul><li><p>Array based pyramid scheme</p> <ul><li><p>An early adopter in this scheme can redeem their multiplied
